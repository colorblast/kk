# kk

kk is a work in progress c++ implementation of a variety of recursive filters, leading up to kalman filters. It is the c++ transmogrification of Richard Lappe's excellent github repository on kalman filters. It is built and unit tested with cmake, catch2, and nix flakes (based on flake-parts and nix-academy's series on nix with c++). The goal is to finish this, then create some form of data wrapper class and graph class so we can see the result of different filters.
